## Usage:

1. Install the project dependencies (SASS compiler) with your favourite package manager, for example:

> $ npm install

2. Watch the files for changes:

> $ npm run watch

3. Edit any file of the 'sass' directory and check that the code is compiling automatically by the 'watch' script, with a message like the following:

> Compiled sass/index.scss to css/styles.css

4. Refresh the browser and **voil√°!** all the SASS styles are loaded to the website's css stylesheet
